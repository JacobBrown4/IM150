    <!-- HTTP Request Info -->
    <!-- 1. A destination address (url) -->
    <!-- 2. "Verb"/HTTP action method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) -->
    <!-- 3. Headers = options describing the request itself, can handle authentication -->
    <!-- 4. Data (optional) = parameters for a GET request, info that would need to be included in the body for POST/PUT/DELETE -->
    <form action="https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells" method="get">
        <!-- input "name" will add a query parameter to the "action" url searching for a "name" = whatever is put in the input -->
        <input name="name" type="text">
        <input type="submit" value="Search!">

    <!-- HTTP ACTIONS -->
    <!-- 
        GET - used to Read existing data
        POST - used to Create new data
        PUT - used to Update data, by completely replacing the old version of the data
        DELETE - used to Delete data, of course
        PATCH - also used to Update data, but with specific changes defined (don't need to worry about full data replacement)

        might not be used as much:
        HEAD - used to list the headers of any outgoing requests from that endpoint
        OPTIONS - used to list the HTTP actions available from that endpoint

     <!-- 
         REST(ful) - "REpresentational State Transfer" to send (transfer) a "state" of the the data being represented in whichever format is specified
         SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
